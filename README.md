# User Account Management â€“ Password Resets & Account Lockouts

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates common **help desk tasks in Active Directory**: resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, and troubleshooting account lockouts.  
The goal is to simulate realistic end-user issues and show proper administrative responses.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture
- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**: `10.0.0.0/24`  
- **Virtual Machines**:
  - `DC-1` â†’ Domain Controller + DNS  
  - `Client-1` â†’ Domain-joined workstation  


---

## ðŸ”¹ Features Implemented
âœ… User account creation (test users: Charlie, Dave)  
âœ… Password reset via ADUC  
âœ… Forced password change at next logon  
âœ… Account lockout simulation and troubleshooting  
âœ… Event Viewer auditing for lockout source

## ðŸ”¹ Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Test Users
- On DC-1 â†’ **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**  
- OU: `Employees`  
- Create users: `Charlie`, `Dave`

---

### 2. Simulate Password Reset
- Select a user â†’ **Reset Password**  
- Check: **User must change password at next logon**  
- Document password complexity requirements

---

### 3. Simulate Account Lockout
- Attempt wrong password multiple times on `Client-1`  
- User account becomes **locked out**  
- On DC-1 â†’ **Event Viewer â†’ Security logs** â†’ locate **lockout source**

### 4. Unlock Account
- In ADUC â†’ right-click locked user â†’ **Unlock Account**  
- Document troubleshooting steps and verify login works

### 5. Test End-User Login
- Log in as the user after password reset  
- Confirm forced password change worked  
- Ensure password complies with **Group Policy complexity**

## ðŸ”¹ Troubleshooting
- **Issue:** User still cannot log in after reset  
  - **Fix:** Verify DNS points to DC-1 private IP  
  - Ensure user is not entering old cached credentials  
- **Issue:** Password does not meet complexity  
  - **Fix:** Check Group Policy â†’ Password Policy

## ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated
- AD user account management  
- Password resets & account unlocks  
- Event Viewer auditing  
- Security compliance enforcement  
- Real-world help desk troubleshooting  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Next Steps / Enhancements
- Document **frequent lockout patterns** to automate alerts  
- Implement **self-service password reset portal**  
- Track **user training metrics** to reduce help desk tickets
